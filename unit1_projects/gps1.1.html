    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Pair programming is a an approach to coding that involves two individuals sharing a work product with one developer acting as a "driver", ie takes the lead in typing in and testing the code; with the other developer acting as the "navigator" to lead on decision-making and direction.  The roles are interchangeable with both developers actively involved in the decision-making and coding processes, with the aspiration that one developer alone will lead in one task at any one time.  It is a product of agile software development approaches.</p>

    <h2>The Challenges</h2>
    <p>One of the primary challenges I have found in pair programming is resisting the urge to go off route when driving.  It is really easy to succumb to the urge to fix that little bit of code you just noticed that is incorrect instead of doing as your navigator is directing.  Another challenge is to ensure that roles are changed, so that the driver becomes the navigator and vice-versa.  Finally, a key challenge could be frustration regarding communication styles, fortunately we did not experience this for this exercise!!</p>

    <h2>The Benefits</h2>
    <p>One of most obvious benefits of pair programming is, as with most tasks, two heads being better than one, particularly with regard to idea generation and problem-solving, including debugging.</p>
