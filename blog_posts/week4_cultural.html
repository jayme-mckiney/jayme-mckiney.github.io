        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>In todays society nearly everything we could need or want to do can be done or at least arranged online.  This is why cyber security is a ever growing problem facing the technology sector.  As our lives grow more and more intertwined with technology we become more and more vulnerable to cyber threats.</p>
        <p>For the individual the risk to these threats are generally related to identity theft and the potential hit to their credit rating.  In the corporate world however the threat is larger than even the potential threat to their precious IP for those in the technological service industry.  For these companies successful attack or even things like the looming eye of the NSA can spell disaster for their consumer confidence.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately there is no silver bullet to solve all of the worlds woes in the realm of computer security, or any type of security for that matter.  There exists no security measures that are truly impregnable, given the proper time and motivation everything is vulnerable.  That being said we shouldn't throw your hands in the air and simply accept our impending doom.  The individual can start with maintaining good password practices, meaning different passwords for the different sites and services you subscribe to, since a chain is only as strong as it's weakest link.  And for the developers of the systems it will require a resurgent energy be put into security measures and staying vigilante to arising exploits such as heartbleed, so that they can respond in a timely fashion to close the hole.</p>
