        <h2>The Pairing and Feedback Experience</h2>
        <h3>Pairing</h3>
        <p>Collaborative programming is something that was largely missing from my previous education in programming.  During my college years group work would usually be divided up into logical sections of methods, done individually and then put together later.  Then during my days as a Java developer I was working by myself to maintain the software I was responsible for.  So all this pairing has been a fairly positive experience that I think I have benefited from quite a bit.  It has been very interesting seeing how others go about solving the problems presented in the challenges.  I would say the most challenging part of the pairing for me stems from the same problem that causes my code to be less than ideal in the area human readability, which is that if something is very clear and simple to me I tend to assume that it will be clear to others, though this is obviously not going to always be the case as everyone is different and thinks differently.</p>
        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>The experience with giving feedback has been different and honestly the most difficult part has probably been coming finding a weakness for my partner to work on, especially when pairing on some of the shorter challenges or when they have already worked on the challenge by themselves since the areas that they might struggle in will be far less noticeable.  In regards to the feedback that I have received it has largely lined up with what I expected namely that I need to work on my communication a bit.  I can definitely get lost in thought and stop explaining what I am thinking when I start to tackle a problem.  I think this is mostly a result of my not wanting to share my idea until I have worked through it enough that I am sure it will work.  The solution to my reported shortcomings appear to be simple enough, just stop censoring the early stages of my thought process and share my ideas before I am 100% sure of them.  Also to try to make sure I am explaining what the code I am asking my partner to type will be doing while I am navigating</p>
