        <h3>Thinking styles</h3>
        <p>According to a test to find my <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc thinking style</a> I am primarily seated in the sections of Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential, though the other scores aren't to far behind.  What this essentially means is that I really like to find the answer to a problem on my own through experimentation and good old trial and error, which is most assuredly the case I am that male stereotype who refuses to ask for directions.  Also there is the other part of me that is always analyzing what the next best move is to a situation and my love of challenges that can be solved with logic.</p>
        <p>So far the biggest challenge for me in the Dev Bootcamp curriculum has easily been the actual design aspects presented in week 1.  I think the reason for this is split between to points.  The first being that while I have always had a very growth mindset in regards to most aspects of life, there is very little I don't think myself capable of, this has never been the case in regards to more artistic pursuits.  For some reason I always just viewed this as a talent rather than a learnable skill like everything else in life.  The latter being that I have always been a bit of a perfectionist, this has never been a problem when the subject has a clearly defined endpoint and some objective measurable quality.  However in the realm of aesthetics quality is far more subjective so I have been prone to second guessing myself and spending copious amounts of time on needless redesigns.</p>
        <p>I think the primary solution to this is obviously to work at allowing myself to view artistic rendering as a skill rather than a talent which I can already see myself accepting from the mere one week of experience that was thrust upon me.  And for the second part of the issue aside from simply not being my own worst critic I think I possible solution might be to actually seek outside confirmation about my work rather than let the echo chamber of my own mind undermine my confidence in my design.</p>
