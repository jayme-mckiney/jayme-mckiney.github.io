        <h2>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h2>
        <p>When I am at my happiest, proudest and most satisfied the following values come to mind.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Adventure</li>
          <li>Grace on fire</li>
          <li>Self-reliance</li>
          <li>Knowledge</li>
          <li>Integrity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Self-reliance has been a priority of mine for as long as I can remember and honestly ties in very closely with my value of knowledge.  When I was younger it began with a curiosity about the parts of my hobbies that would normally be outsourced, even if it would be impractical or impossible for me to complete these tasks I would still desire to know how to complete them.  Later in life this value was amplified by the rather spend thrift nature instilled in me by my grandparents, why pay someone else to do something I am perfectly capable of doing myself?</p>
        <p>As for how I try to live up to these values I think thats a rather silly question as we were asked to choose those most important to us.  So isn't it obvious fives a crossed the board.  Go big or go home.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking if one of my friends is asking me for advice they have some piece of technology that is either broke or misbehaving.  As one of the resident geeks in my circle of friends it tends to fall to me to tell them how and if there device can be salvaged.  This obviously ties in with knowledge and self-reliance seeings as I cultivated that knowledge with my unwillingness to accept that any IT professional might be able to fix something I could not if I applied myself. </p>
        <p>As I said before in the original writing prompt about stereotype threat I don't feel I have ever been effected by it in any meaningful fashion.  It has always been my experience that if I am feeling particularly down the best medicine for me is a good strong dose of endorphins from a run or any exercise really.</p>
