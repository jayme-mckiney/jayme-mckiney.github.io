        <h3>Asking Questions?</h3>
        <p>Honestly I have never given much thought about how to best ask a question.  My initial thoughts when given this prompt were, raise the inflection of your voice at then end of your sentence.  But obviously there are good and poor ways to ask a question.  For instance a little over a week ago when I moved to San Francisco I was staying with some old friends,  they had been here a while so when I arrived I jokingly asked them how to San Francisco.  Obviously this was a pretty pathetically formed question as it was absurdly vague.</p>
        <p>A good question is foremost clear and concise.  If your question drags on endlessly or is vague or otherwise confusing obviously people are going to avoid answering it or simply answer it poorly as they don't understand what it is you are truly asking.  If writing your question on the Internet its important to keep spelling and grammar in mind, both because it's important to make a decent impression so others might want to help you and because poor enough spelling and grammar can lead to ambiguity.  Also important if asking a question on the Internet is your title, this should give a brief and clear synopsis of the problem, its probably a bad idea to try and be witty clever or funny.</p>
        <p>In the realm of coding its important to give the full context of your problem so that anyone trying to help will be able to reproduce whatever problems you are encountering and help you resolve them.  However you should probably not be dumping the entirety of your code base on the site or person you are asking for help, you should attempt to isolate the smallest portion that will allow them to understand and recreate the problem and functionality of the code in question.</p>
        <p>Personally I have never asked a question on stackoverflow or any other similar site as I have never encountered an issue that hadn't already been asked on them after a brief Google search.  In fact they had normally been asked a plethora of times, so I would say it is equally important to simply Google your question to see if it has already been submitted.</p>
