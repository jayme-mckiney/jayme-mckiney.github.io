        <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
        <p>Stereotype Threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group.  This basically means that if woman thinks women are bad at math this might cause her to perform worse on a math test, or if a white man believes that white men can't jump he might psyche himself out of being able to dunk.</p>
        <p>Personally I don't believe I have ever really felt this pressure, being a white male with the last name McKiney I self identify as Irish.  While one could accuse me of being a bit of a lush or a little lazy and not be entirely wrong, I think it would be a stretch to attempt to attribute either of these things to stereotype threat.  Though I suppose the stereotype in general could be a contributing factor towards my acceptance of these generally negative traits.</p>
        <p>I have personally always been a strong believer in the notion that a word or a stereotype for that matter only has the power you give it over yourself.  And I guess that would be my primary advice to someone I though might be suffering from stereotype threat, that you are and unique individual not simply an instance of a subclass of the Human object with a poorly written set of methods for some given topic.  Apologies for the out of place programming reference but in my defense I did just finish a programming blog entry.</p>
