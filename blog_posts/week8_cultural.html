        <h2>Dealing with Conflict</h2>
        <p>Honestly my default method for dealing with conflict has always been one of avoidance.  In many cases this has served me well since a lot of conflicts I find myself in tend to be kind of frivolous they tend to just blow over if left alone.  However this is certainly not always the case, some problems just don't go away no matter how much you want them to.</p>
        <p>One situation I can think of is during the end of my last serious relationship.  My avoidance of one of our larger conflicts put further strain on the growing distance between us and our newfound differences of opinion.  And really only served to cause an even greater build up of resentment on both sides.  While I don't honestly believe the relationship could have been saved by a more direct approach and a lot less avoidance it would have saved both of us from wasting our precious time spent in a relationship with no future and possibly have allowed us to remain on speaking terms as opposed to the complete break of contact that happened.</p>
        <p>So I guess what I learned from this experience is that no matter how much you may want them to some problems just won't starve themselves out without attention like a flame with no oxygen.  The real struggle as I see it is being able to identify a legitimate problem that needs addressing from a silly conflict best ignored.</p>
