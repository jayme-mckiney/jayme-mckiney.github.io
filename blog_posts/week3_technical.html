        <h3>Javascript</h3>
        <p>Javascript has long been a staple of web devopment, whether you wanted to dynamically change the contents of the page or interact with the user in some way.  However in the past neither of these things was paticularly easy to do especially the altering of contents, Netscape and IE could both do this however they both did it in there own completely different way.  Now however with the widespread adoption and popularization of the language there are frameworks emerging all the time to make life easier for developers, ie node.js, jquery, AngularJS etc.</p>
        <p>One of the great things about javascript in its more convential use-case is that it allows the outsourcing of valuable computation time away from the server and out to the browser of the end user.  This is a great thing as a developer since servers are expensive and outsourcing those cycle to the user allows more scalability to the application that is being made.  This does however have its potential downsides obviously if the user has an older machine which can't handle the workload the application might be slugish or even unusable, and will simply not work if the user has their browswer set to not run javascript for either performance or security reasons.</p>
