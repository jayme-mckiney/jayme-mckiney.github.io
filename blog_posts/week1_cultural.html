      <h3>Kitchen Vs Table</h3>
      <p>Having watched Shereefs video I am feeling comfortable with Dev Bootcamp culture.  At times I have been mildly worried about my experience with programming compared to that of someone who is green to the subject.  However given what Shereef said and what I have been told from other sources I feel that the environment will be a great place for me since I am no stranger to the idea of buckling down and learning things on my own if a subject is review for me.  Also given that his assertion that I know very little about web development is fairly spot on</p>

      <p>My expectations of Dev Bootcamp are still fairly in line with where they began.  And while I am mildly nervous since I am a bit of an introvert, I am confident I can overcome this.  Because being surrounded by a group of people also trying to learn everything they can about web development sounds amazing!</p>
