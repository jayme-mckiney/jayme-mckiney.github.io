        <h3>XKCD</h3>
        <p>
          I have been visiting this site for years entirely for the comics as they are very smart, fun, silly, nerdy and occasionally kind of dark.  Recently the author has added another section called what-if which I also find immensely entertaining.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visually the site is lightly colored, rounded, simple, structured, .  When visiting the site my eyes are usually drawn the the logo at the top in the header and then to the comic which is the basis of the site.  There isn't all that much to navigate simply the comics the new book section and the store.  All of these are easy to get to from any page and you can easily flip through the comics.  Though there is no search function if you were looking for a specific comic, however I am not sure how much use that would be anyway as I would likely not recall the name of the comic I was looking for.
        </p>

          After visiting the site I am usually happy since the comics tend to crack me up.  And while the site does have a store I have never actually bought anything from it, however this has more to do with my general thrifty nature than the site itself.

        <h3>Reddit</h3>
        <p>
          Over the years reddit has become like a drug for me, I may not have the urge to view the site but after I do I usually find myself browsing for entirely to long.  Since the content of reddit is user submitted it can very greatly based upon which subreddit you are viewing.
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes are immediately drawn to the content pane when I load the page, which should certainly be the focal point due to the content centric nature of the site. Visually the site is lightly colored, cluttered, basic, squared, and plain.  The primary means of navigating away from the front page and to other specific subreddits is rather small and I would imagine hard to find for new users.  But if you are simply going to view the content that has made it to the front page the site is straight forward, simply a list of articles with a next button at the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I have been on the site for an extended period of time I generally feel as though I have wasted a large chunk of my life, since I begin to just mindlessly look through all of the content.  The only thing the site sells to my knowlege is the ability to give "reddit gold" which I have never purchased because it makes even less since to me than the "karma points" that most reddit users are so obsessed with that come from being upvoted from other users.

        <h3>Life hacker</h3>
        <p>I have been viewing this site for a few years because I love the content.  The articles are usually ingenuitive, fun, practical, smart, and enlightening or some combination therein. </p>
        <p>My eyes are usually drawn to the picture that accompanies the first or second article.  I believe this is there intention since the articles are definitely the center point of the site as with all the sites under the gawker umbrella.  Visually the site is light, plain, crowded, squared, and simple.  The site is easy enough to navigate if you are happy to view there most recent or most popular posts, however I have always found the large sidebar dedicated to there popular stories to be rather obtrusive and unhelpful since you are unable to go beyond the first ten or so entries.</p>
        <p>Generally I leave this site feeling content as I have usually learned something new and as GI Joe taught me know is half the battle.</p>
